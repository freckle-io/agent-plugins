# Waterfalls

An enrichment waterfall runs structured providers in order of precision, falls back on insufficiency, and ends in a Research Agent backstop. When reading an existing Workflow, recognize this shape before editing it: provider branch cases, per-fallback branches, a convergence collector, and a final all-fallbacks-failed output are the waterfall — they survive an edit intact unless the request explicitly changes the fallback design.

## Construction

- Primary: the most precise structured provider for the pinned objective.
- Trace the input Dataset through its Push to Dataset handoff to the producing Workflow before ordering providers. A provider that produced the pushed entity is an already-attempted provider for fields carried by that entity: use its pushed field as a source value instead of adding another call to the same provider for that data point.
- Branch on insufficiency: each fallback provider runs only on its fallback branch, strictly after the rung above it misses.
- Final fallback: Research Agent, per [research-agent.md](research-agent.md). Every waterfall gets its own backstop — including a mid-Workflow waterfall that recovers an identifier (a LinkedIn URL, a domain). A Research Agent elsewhere doing a different job (scoring, summarizing, verifying at the end) is not the backstop: a missed identifier starves every structured provider downstream of it, and a tail agent cannot resurrect that chain — only a backstop inside the waterfall keeps it alive.
- Converge fallback outputs through one collector at the earliest shared value, then continue with a single downstream chain — duplicating a downstream provider per branch is node bloat. See [collector.md](collector.md), including its re-gating pattern.
- Plan the all-fallbacks-failed path: what the Workflow emits when every provider comes up empty.
- Skip a fallback only when its contract does not fit the pinned objective, the node is unavailable in the destination org, or the user explicitly chose a different fallback policy.

For example, when the objective is to find work email and upstream Apollo Find People pushed each person into the input Dataset, select and order the eligible fresh email providers by their inspected contracts: **FindyMail → LeadMagic → original Apollo email**. The pushed Apollo email represents the already-attempted provider, so use it as the source fallback instead of adding another Apollo call.
